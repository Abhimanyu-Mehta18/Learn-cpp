# C++ Concepts Explained

This repository is a personal archive of C++ fundamentals that I created while learning the language. It contains categorized folders with `.cpp` files covering different topics â€” each with brief explanations and working examples.

> This is not an official tutorial â€” it's a learning journal meant to reinforce my understanding and help others starting out.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The repository is organized by topic:

- `01-basics/` â€” input-output, variables, datatypes
- `02-control-structure/` â€” functions, loops, conditionals
- `03-operators/` â€” arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise
- `04-pointers/` â€” basics, pointer arithmetic, pointers to functions
- `05-arguments/` â€” basics, pass by reference, pass by value, pass by pointer
- `06-arrays/` â€” 1D/2D arrays
- `07-object-oriented/` â€” classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- `08-file-handling/` â€” reading/writing to files
- `09-exception-handling/` â€” try-catch, custom exceptions
- `10-structures/` â€” user defined datatypes(structures) 


Each folder contains:
- Well-commented `.cpp` files

## ðŸš€ Why I Made This

While learning C++, I wanted a clean, modular way to revisit and reinforce core concepts. This repo acts as:
- A revision tool for myself
- A reference for others who may benefit from clear, example-driven learning

## âœ… Disclaimer

This repo is for learning purposes only. All code is written by me during self-study and is intended for educational use.
